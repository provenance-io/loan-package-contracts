## Development
### Commands
#### Cloning the Repository
```shell
git clone https://github.com/provenance-io/loan-package-contracts.git
cd loan-package-contracts/
```
#### Building the project
```shell
./gradlew clean build --refresh-dependencies
```
#### Bootstrapping the contracts
See [here](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-gradle-plugin/#tasks) for more details on the p8e tasks.

The following command will put the contracts into an [object store](https://github.com/provenance-io/object-store): 
```shell
./gradlew p8eClean p8eCheck p8eBootstrap
```
In order for the bootstrapping to succeed, the following environment variables will need to be defined:
```shell
OS_GRPC_URL             # The URL to your object store that will store the contracts
PROVENANCE_GRPC_URL     # The URL to the Provenance instance the contracts will run against
ENCRYPTION_PRIVATE_KEY
SIGNING_PRIVATE_KEY
CHAIN_ID                # The ID of the chain - use chain-local locally and pio-testnet-1 for the test environment
```
For local development, you can quickly get necessary Docker containers running and said environment values populated by
using [p8e-scope-sdk/dev-tools](https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-scope-sdk/blob/main/dev-tools/compose/README.md):
```shell
git clone https://github.com/provenance-io/p8e-scope-sdk.git
cd p8e-scope-sdk/dev-tools/compose/
docker compose up -d
source ./host.env
cd /PathToYour/loan-package-contracts
./gradlew p8eBootstrap
```
#### Publishing local artifacts
To publish to your machine's local Maven repository, use
```shell
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal -xsignMavenPublication
```
#### Linting
This project uses [Ktlint](https://github.com/pinterest/ktlint).

To immediately view linting errors, use
```shell
./gradlew clean ktlintCheck
```
To generate linting reports, use
```shell
./gradlew ktlintCheck
```
To have the linter update your code to fit the linting rules, use
```shell
./gradlew ktlintFormat
```
